		<p>I have been thinking lately about alternative implementations of voting systems, and have an idea about one that I want to flesh out and possibly make a website for. It might not be ideal or feasible for national United States elections, but there are a lot of other organizations that have governance structures that it could be an easy and good option for (corporations, schools, clubs, etc.)</p>
